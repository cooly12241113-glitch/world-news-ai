## Current Milestone

Milestone 02 — Pre-Renderer Integration & Completeness Audit

**Status:** READY_WITH_NON_BLOCKING_DEBT

## Completed delivery

- Sprint 00–03: Event-centric domain and strict runtime validation
- Sprint 04: generalized source/evidence domain

- Sprint 07: evidence-first EventDossier
- Sprint 08: question intent and BriefingContract
- Sprint 09: evidence retrieval and EvidenceContextPackage
- Milestone 01: boundary, compatibility, determinism, provenance,
  failure-mode, security/privacy, dependency/runtime, and end-to-end audit

## Current delivery

Sprint 13.1 — Interactive Briefing Renderer hardening.

**Status:** Complete

Validated BriefingScripts drive a fixture-only React/Vite player with MapLibre
behind an adapter, deterministic motion planning, accessible map/chart/document/
evidence surfaces, Bottom Composer, manual-only scene navigation, playback
controls, replay scene motion, and responsive safe viewport behavior.

## Next target

Sprint 14 — Interactive Briefing Session and Follow-up.

**Status:** DESIGNED / NOT IMPLEMENTED

Sprint 14.0 defines the deterministic session state machine, follow-up/replan
contracts, replacement policy, implementation matrix, and acceptance criteria.
Implementation has not started.

- [Sprint 14 design](Sprint-14-Interactive-Briefing-Session.md)
- [Session state machine](../architecture/Briefing-Session-State-Machine.md)
- [Follow-up and replanning contract](../architecture/Follow-up-and-Replanning-Contract.md)
- [Implementation matrix](../architecture/Sprint-14-Implementation-Matrix.md)

## Known non-blocking debt

Production DNS-rebinding controls, complete knowledge-record persistence,
semantic retrieval, context-package persistence, and operational
retention/redaction policy remain future work.
